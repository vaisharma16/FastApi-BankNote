# Machine Learning Model Deployment with FastAPI

This repository contains a project demonstrating how to deploy machine learning models using FastAPI. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ that is ideal for deploying machine learning models.

## Project Overview
This project showcases how to:

- Set up a FastAPI application for deploying machine learning models.
- Create API endpoints to interact with the deployed model.
- Integrate a pre-trained machine learning model with FastAPI.
- Test the API to ensure it functions correctly.

## Key Features
- FastAPI Setup: Learn how to set up a FastAPI application and configure the environment.
- API Endpoint Creation: Implement endpoints to handle requests and interact with the machine learning model.
- Model Integration: Load and use a pre-trained machine learning model within the FastAPI application.
- Testing: Use tools like Postman or cURL to test API functionality.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaisharma16/FastApi-BankNote.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
